# Dynamo PR Review

Empirical, end-to-end workflow for testing an `ai-dynamo/dynamo` PR and leaving a scoped, evidence-backed review.

**Principle: read the diff to form hypotheses, then prove or refute them by running the code.** The end-to-end check is the repo's own `examples/backends/sglang/launch/agg.sh` (aggregated serving: one frontend + one SGLang worker on a single GPU), driven with real traffic.

Sibling skill: `sglang-pr-review` (pure SGLang). This one is for the Dynamo serving layer; it brings up the full frontend + worker stack.

## Boundaries — read-only on the PR

This skill **tests and reviews**; it never changes the PR. The PR author owns every code change.

- **Never** commit/push to the PR branch or the author's fork, never force-push, never apply suggestions or `gh pr` mutations (no edit, no commit-to-branch, no merge/close). You are a reviewer, not a committer.
- Any local edits needed to get the build/test running are **throwaway** — discarded at cleanup, never pushed anywhere.
- The **only** outbound action is leaving a review *comment* (findings + evidence), and **only after the user explicitly approves sharing it**. Default to producing the review locally and prompting the user to share.
- If you find a fix, **describe it in the review** for the author to apply — do not apply it for them.

## Hardware fit — check first

Default target: **1× L4** (~24 GB, Ada sm_89, single GPU). `agg.sh` is single-GPU aggregated serving.

After reading the PR, **stop and tell the user** if testing it needs more than 1 GPU / 24 GB, e.g.:
- Disaggregated serving (`disagg.sh` needs ≥2 GPUs: separate prefill + decode workers).
- A model that won't fit in 24 GB even quantized, or TP/PP/DP/EP > 1.
- Multi-node, or a GPU arch the L4 lacks (Hopper/Blackwell-only kernels, fp4).

Otherwise almost any change is testable with a **small model on 1 GPU** (default `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`) — the model is just a vehicle for the changed code path. Pick a model only as big as needed to exercise the change.

## Step 0 — Inputs

Confirm: **PR number** (repo defaults to `ai-dynamo/dynamo`), and anything the PR needs (a model, flag, or request shape — e.g. a tool-calling change needs a request with `tools` + `tool_choice`).

## Step 1 — Checkout the PR

Dynamo carries a Rust core, so reuse the canonical build tree rather than a throwaway clone (a clean clone would recompile Rust from scratch):

```bash
PR=<number>
cd /ephemeral/dynamo
# STOP and ask only on *tracked* modifications/staged changes (the user's work).
# Untracked files are fine — `gh pr checkout` ignores them.
git status --porcelain | grep -vE '^\?\?' && echo "tracked changes present -> STOP, ask the user" || echo "no tracked changes, safe to proceed"
git fetch origin && git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
ORIG_REF=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)   # to restore later
gh pr checkout $PR
git log --oneline -1
```

**For A/B testing** (comparing PR vs main), use separate worktrees with separate venvs so both can run independently:

```bash
# PR branch in its own worktree + venv
git worktree add /ephemeral/dynamo-wt/pr-$PR fork-<owner>/<branch>
cd /ephemeral/dynamo-wt/pr-$PR
uv venv .venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install exact sglang version from pyproject.toml (see Step 2)
```

Read the diff and plan:
```bash
gh pr diff $PR --repo ai-dynamo/dynamo | tee /tmp/dyn-pr-$PR.diff
```
Note whether the diff touches **Rust** (`lib/**/*.rs`, `*/Cargo.toml`) or is **Python-only** — it decides the build in Step 2. Form concrete expectations (what should change in responses / logs / metrics / perf) and grep for any caller the diff might have missed.

## Step 2 — Build

Use only the active checkout's `.venv`; never reuse the canonical checkout's venv from a worktree. Stop if `.venv` is a symlink:

```bash
ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$ROOT"
if [ -L .venv ]; then echo ".venv must be local to $ROOT" >&2; exit 1; fi
test -x .venv/bin/python || uv venv .venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Environment prerequisites (do once, check first)

**CUDA PATH**: Verify `nvcc` points to CUDA 12+, not the stale `/usr/bin/nvcc` (CUDA 11.5):
```bash
nvcc --version  # should show CUDA 12.x or 13.x
# If not:
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-13.0/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-13.0/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-}
```
Permanent fix: add the above exports to `~/.bashrc`.

**huggingface_hub version**: transformers 5.6.0 requires `huggingface_hub>=1.5.0,<2.0`. Install it explicitly before `uv pip install -e .` to prevent uv from resolving to an incompatible version:
```bash
uv pip install "huggingface_hub>=1.5.0,<2.0"
```
Do NOT downgrade huggingface_hub below 1.5.0 — transformers 5.6.0 imports `is_offline_mode` from it, which was removed in the 0.33.x/0.34.x range.

**SGLang version**: Always install the exact version pinned in `pyproject.toml`:
```bash
# Check what pyproject.toml requires:
grep sglang pyproject.toml
# Install it (example for sglang 0.5.12.post1):
uv pip install --prerelease=allow "sglang[diffusion]==0.5.12.post1"
```
Do NOT debug version conflicts between sglang/transformers/huggingface_hub/kernels — if the pinned version doesn't import cleanly after the above fixes, that's a **compatibility finding about the PR**, not something to fix locally.

### Build steps

With the checkout-local venv active, rebuild only what changed and verify editable imports resolve inside the active checkout:

```bash
ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$ROOT"
# Rust touched? rebuild the binding (slow, incremental):
cd "$ROOT/lib/bindings/python" && maturin develop --uv
# Always refresh the Python package (fast):
cd "$ROOT" && uv pip install -e .
python -c "import dynamo, dynamo.sglang, sglang; print('ok', dynamo.__file__, sglang.__version__)"
```

Python-only PRs need only the `uv pip install -e .` (often the editable tree is already live — just relaunch the server). If `import sglang` fails, the backend isn't installed — install it before launching.

**For A/B worktrees**: Build in the worktree's own venv. No need to rebuild sglang from source — it's a pip package. Only the Rust binding (`maturin develop`) and Python package (`uv pip install -e .`) need rebuilding.

## Step 3 — Bring up etcd + NATS

Dynamo needs etcd (discovery) and NATS (transport). Reuse if present, else start them; handle a busy 2379 (a k8s etcd may hold it) by using an alternate port:

```bash
# NATS (default nats://localhost:4222)
pgrep -x nats-server >/dev/null || nats-server -p 4222 >/tmp/nats.log 2>&1 &

# etcd: prefer a usable 2379; else REUSE a healthy standalone etcd on 12379; else start one.
if curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:2379/health >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  : # default etcd on 2379 is reachable over plain http -- use it
elif curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:12379/health >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export ETCD_ENDPOINTS=http://127.0.0.1:12379   # reuse already-running standalone etcd
else
  etcd --data-dir /tmp/dyn-etcd --name dyn \
    --listen-client-urls http://127.0.0.1:12379 --advertise-client-urls http://127.0.0.1:12379 \
    --listen-peer-urls http://127.0.0.1:12390 --initial-advertise-peer-urls http://127.0.0.1:12390 \
    --initial-cluster dyn=http://127.0.0.1:12390 >/tmp/dyn-etcd.log 2>&1 &
  sleep 3; export ETCD_ENDPOINTS=http://127.0.0.1:12379
fi
```

## Step 4 — Launch agg.sh (background)

`agg.sh` starts `dynamo.frontend` (OpenAI API on :8000) + one `dynamo.sglang` worker (system metrics on :8081). It forwards unknown flags to the worker.

```bash
pkill -9 -f "dynamo.sglang" 2>/dev/null; pkill -9 -f "dynamo.frontend" 2>/dev/null; sleep 2
cd /ephemeral/dynamo
ETCD_ENDPOINTS=${ETCD_ENDPOINTS:-http://127.0.0.1:2379} DYN_LOG=debug \
  bash examples/backends/sglang/launch/agg.sh --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  > /tmp/dyn-agg-$PR.log 2>&1 &
```

**Launch the `bash agg.sh …` line as its OWN detached background task.** `agg.sh` sets `trap 'kill 0' EXIT`, so if you chain it after `cd`/`source`/`export` inside a single `set -e` shell the trap can tear down the process group. Keep env vars on the same line as the `bash agg.sh` invocation.

Then poll readiness and bail on failure signatures:
```bash
until curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/models | grep -q Qwen; do
  grep -qiE "Traceback|exited with code|CUDA out of memory|Unable to create lease|Killed|nvcc fatal" /tmp/dyn-agg-$PR.log \
    && { tail -40 /tmp/dyn-agg-$PR.log; break; }
  sleep 3
done
```

- `/v1/models` returning the model = worker registered and ready (the frontend `/health` comes up first, before the worker).
- The frontend logs a stream of harmless `ERROR ... status=404 ... uri=/` (root-path polls) before/while the worker registers — **not** a failure; ignore them.
- `WARN registry.import_model_classes: Ignore import error` lines are also harmless (optional model classes not in this transformers version).
- Real failures match the grep above. `nvcc fatal: Unsupported gpu architecture` = CUDA PATH issue (see Step 2).

## Step 5 — Test the PR's claim

**Before load testing, verify the PR's actual claim with targeted tests.**

### Code structure tests (run first, no server needed)
- Verify the diff does what it claims (e.g., method removed, field renamed)
- Check for missed callers the diff should have updated
- Run any existing unit tests: `python -m pytest components/.../tests/ -x -q`

### Correctness testing (streaming vs non-streaming)
For PRs that change output formatting, token handling, or response structure, use a **sequential comparison** (same server, same model) instead of A/B across branches:

```python
# Send identical requests (temperature=0) via streaming and non-streaming
# Compare outputs byte-for-byte
# Use diverse prompts: ASCII, multibyte Unicode, code, reasoning, edge cases
```

This is cheaper than running two servers and avoids cross-version dependency conflicts.

### Load test with aiperf
```bash
uvx aiperf profile \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --url http://localhost:8000 \
  --endpoint-type chat --streaming \
  --concurrency 16 --num-requests 256 \
  --prompt-input-tokens-mean 512 --output-tokens-mean 128 \
  --num-warmup-requests 8
```

For a correctness/feature change, also hit `/v1/chat/completions` directly with `curl` to inspect the exact response (tool_calls, content, finish_reason) — aiperf is for throughput/latency, curl is for correctness. For a **correctness-only** PR, scale `--num-requests` down (e.g. 32).

**Run tests 2-3 times** — first run warms up KV cache and may show flaky results. Only report failures that are consistent across runs.

## Step 6 — Analyze

For each hypothesis from Step 1:
- **Responses** — `curl` the endpoint; check the field the PR affects.
- **Logs** — grep `/tmp/dyn-agg-$PR.log` for the changed code path and for any new WARN/ERROR.
- **Metrics** — `/metrics` on the frontend `:8000` and worker `:8081`.
- **Perf** — aiperf summary; A/B vs `main` (separate worktree + venv) if the PR claims a perf delta. Control ordering, fresh server per phase.

Keep the concrete responses / log lines / numbers — they go in the review verbatim.

Only after testing and analysis are complete, ask the user whether to invoke `full-code-review` on the PR. Do not invoke it automatically.

## Step 7 — Report, then post the review (on approval)

Summarize to the user first: what works (with evidence), what's broken/risky (`file:line` + evidence + severity), recommendation. **Do not post to GitHub until the user approves.**

### When to post a review comment

**Only post a review comment if something failed, looks risky, or you have a question.** If the PR is clean and all tests pass, do not post anything — just report the verdict to the user and move on.

- All tests pass, no concerns → **no comment on GitHub**, just tell the user "clean, approved"
- Test failure, bug found, or design concern → post a comment with the finding
- Unclear about author's intent → **ask the user first** before posting any question to the author

**Always clear questions with the user before posting them as review comments.** Never ask the PR author something directly without the user's explicit approval.

### Review comment template

Use this template when you DO need to post a comment. The `<details>` dropdown keeps verbose evidence out of the main view:

```markdown
## Review Summary

**Verdict:** Approve / Request changes / Comment

<One-paragraph summary of what the PR does and the overall assessment.>

### Testing Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Unit tests | **X/Y passed** |
| E2E: <feature> (non-streaming) | Pass/Fail + brief note |
| E2E: <feature> (streaming) | Pass/Fail + brief note |
| E2E: Normal request (no <feature>) | Pass/Fail + brief note |
| Load test (aiperf, N req, M concurrency) | Pass/Fail + throughput |
| Server logs | Clean / Issues |

<details>
<summary>Evidence</summary>

```
Paste concrete evidence here: curl responses, aiperf summary table, log lines, etc.
```

</details>

### Code Review

<Bullet points of findings — one per issue or positive observation. Include file:line references.>
```

**IMPORTANT: Always create a DRAFT review first.** GitHub does not allow deleting submitted reviews (only pending/draft ones). Create the review as a draft, confirm with the user, then submit it.

Once approved:
```bash
# 1. Create as DRAFT (not visible to PR author until submitted)
REVIEW_ID=$(gh api --method POST repos/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pulls/$PR/reviews \
  -f commit_id=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \
  -f body="<review body>" \
  -f event="COMMENT" \
  --jq '.id')

# 2. Show user the draft content, get approval, then submit:
gh api --method POST repos/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pulls/$PR/reviews/$REVIEW_ID/events \
  -f event="SUBMIT" -f body="<final body>"
```

- `commit_id` = `git rev-parse HEAD` of the PR branch; each comment `line` must be in the diff (RIGHT side).
- Default `event: "COMMENT"`; Approve / Request-changes only if the user asks.
- One inline comment per finding, with the captured evidence. Concrete and kind.

## Step 8 — Persist the review to memory

File it under the `dynamo-pr-reviews` umbrella project in `~/memory` (one subfolder per PR):
```bash
DIR=~/memory/dynamo-pr-reviews/$PR-<slug>; mkdir -p "$DIR"
# $DIR/review.md: PR + branch, test setup (agg.sh, model), evidence, findings, posted-review link, verdict
```

Register the row in `~/memory/dynamo-pr-reviews/INDEX.md` (create it if missing; frontmatter `type: project`, `last-updated`), then `python3 ~/memory/scripts/lint_memory.py`.

Commit **only your files**:
```bash
cd ~/memory && git add dynamo-pr-reviews && git commit -m "dynamo-pr-reviews: add #$PR review" && git push
```

## Cleanup

```bash
pkill -9 -f "dynamo.sglang"; pkill -9 -f "dynamo.frontend"
cd /ephemeral/dynamo && git checkout "${ORIG_REF:-main}"
# Remove A/B worktrees if created:
git worktree remove /ephemeral/dynamo-wt/pr-$PR 2>/dev/null
```

If Rust was rebuilt for the PR, a `maturin develop --uv` on the restored branch puts the binding back. Leave etcd/NATS running (cheap) unless asked.

## Pitfalls

1. **CUDA PATH**: `/usr/bin/nvcc` is CUDA 11.5, but CUDA 13.0 is at `/usr/local/cuda-13.0/`. Always prepend that to PATH. `nvcc fatal: Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_89'` = this issue.
2. **huggingface_hub version**: transformers 5.6.0 requires `huggingface_hub>=1.5.0,<2.0`. Install it explicitly before `uv pip install -e .`. Do NOT downgrade below 1.5.0 — `is_offline_mode` was removed in the 0.33.x/0.34.x range and transformers imports it directly.
3. **kernels package**: `transformers` may pull in incompatible `kernels` versions. Pin to `kernels>=0.6.1,<=0.9` if needed.
4. **SGLang version**: Always use the version pinned in `pyproject.toml`. Don't let `uv` resolve to a different version.
5. **Flaky first runs**: Model inference on first run may show different results due to KV cache warm-up. Always run 2-3 times before reporting failures.
6. **A/B testing**: Use separate worktrees + venvs, not shared environments. Sequential comparison (streaming vs non-streaming on same server) is cheaper and more reliable than running two servers.
7. **Environment issues are not PR issues**: If the server won't start due to CUDA/Python/dependency problems, diagnose the environment first. Don't attribute environment breakage to the PR.
8. **SglangTool.model_dump() vs raw dicts**: When a PR changes tool serialization from `copy.deepcopy(raw_tools)` to `SglangTool.model_dump()`, the output structure differs: `strict` is always present (defaults to `false` even when the raw input omits it), and `defer_loading: null` is added at the top level of each tool. These extra fields are generally benign — `false` is semantically equivalent to absent for boolean checks, and `defer_loading` is SGLang-specific that chat templates ignore. Verify empirically with `curl` that tool calling still works, but don't flag these structural differences as bugs.
9. **Streaming test client disconnects**: When testing streaming endpoints, avoid piping `curl` output to `head` or other commands that disconnect early — this triggers a `cancelled before completion` error in Dynamo's logs that looks like a server bug but is actually just the client hanging up. Use `curl -s ... | grep "^data:" | tail -N` or let the stream complete naturally.
